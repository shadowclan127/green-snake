   <p1> <br>The smooth green snake lives mainly in the US and Canada.<br> can be found in many different habitats,
    including marshes, meadows, the edges of streams, and open woods. 
	It prefers to be on the ground, in open areas without a lot of shrubs.
	During hibernation, the smooth green snake looks for burrows, ant hills, and other dug-out underground areas, normally gathering in large numbers.
	It prefers moist habitats and areas near permanent water sources, usually staying in green areas for camouflage.
	Being cold blooded, it prefers warm areas, lying in the sun on rocks and logs, also using them for hiding. </p1>

	<p2><br>The smooth green snake mostly eats insects and spiders,
	 including spineless caterpillars, harvestmen, moths, ants, snails, worms, and slugs. 
	 While hunting, it uses both chemical and visual clues to find prey, and kills with a strike instead of constriction. </p2>
    <h2 id= "behavior">Behavior</h2>
	<p3>The smooth green snake relies on an environment matching its green scales for camouflage to protect itself from predators.
	 If threatened, a smooth green snake will usually flee.
	 It is a docile snake, seldom biting and usually allowing humans to come close. 
	 If provoked, it can secrete a substance from its anal gland, causing a foul smell.
	 When handled by humans, it usually shows excited behavior and calms down after wrapping itself around a finger.
	 When it hunts, it turns its head from side to side, finding prey with its tongue; the flicking of the tongue gathers air towards the snake's head, 
	 and their <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal_organ" target = "_blank"> Jacobson's organ </a> (on the roof of its mouth) interprets the airborne pheromones and chemical signals.
	 The green snake has no ears, relying on vibrations to figure out its surroundings. Its sight is relatively strong, at least over short distances. 
	 Due to the stretchy ligaments in its jaw, it can swallow prey whole, even those that are larger than its own body's diameter. 
	 It can shed its skin as often as every four to five weeks, allowing for new growth.
     During months when the weather is warmer, the smooth green snake tends to be active both day and night; in the colder, winter months, it hibernates in social groups. 
	 Ant hills and burrows of other animals are used during hibernation as part-time homes.</p3>
